Backend data from OpenWeatherMap to MongoDb using NodeJs and Express.

	-> to clarify: Which databases to install on Raspberry Pi 3? I used Mongo DB.
	-> 1st function: Update or insert of the data
	-> 2nd function: plausibility check of the data
	-> The following data ist saved:
		<> Temperature (every 3 hours)
		<> probability of rain (every 3 hours)
		<> Wind speed (every 3 hours)
		<> Wind direction
